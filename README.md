# Connect 4

### I've made this game for a class project and using teacher's source code plus pygame library (for doing the visual view instead of just text).

#### The current features of the application are:

* Multiplayer (local).
* Vs CPU(with a difficulty selector).
* Hint assistance (Ask the heuristic where you should play).
* Tells you the last movement of both players.
* Tells you who's actual playing (player turn).
* Game over screen which says who won.

#### The problems I'm having:

* The heuristic is so simple, need to be improved soon.
* Getting some exceptions while playing, still looking for a solution.
* If you click outside of the board, the game will close because a null pointer exception, will fix this soon.

#### Future features for this project:

* X*Y board size
* Maybe some cool background music and/or some more visual effects
